It read; “Do the dishes or you won’t be fed.” She wanted to write; “Bullshit, Uncle Jim.” Instead, Tabitha  grabbed the pack of Oreos an arms length away. She emerged from her Costco blankets and cartoon printed animal sheet. She hadn’t done the dishes in two weeks. She was a week shy of turning 18.</p> <p>Uncle Jim avoided doing dishes himself, by eating out for his one meal a day. Sometimes Tabitha saw him at Ruby’s, when she had the money to eat; a local spot which served breakfast burritos- all day. Occasionally she’d see Uncle Jim with his ‘friends.’ Sometimes he’d be with women who had towering hair.  Uncle Jim started romances with women who mistook glue for lipstick and play-dough for eyeshadow. None of his women, he’d say, “could count; so why count how many I have of them?” He avoided remembering his lady’s names and called them “bean bean, bing bong, or little thing (even though they were all Heffalumps).” </p>  <p>The thing Tabitha always wanted was a pet with fur. A pet with a name that was not replaced with one like “Rat Bastard,” thanks to Uncle Jim. Tabitha’s mother, Kim had, had a mangy hound that Tabitha loved. Tabitha was nine when Uncle Jim replaced her mom’s dog with a lizard he caught in the front yard. When each lizard died he’d catch a new one and Tabitha thought he had powers to revive things, so why couldn’t he revive her mom? Uncle Jim gave the hound away to Kim’s boss after Kim died.  Each time something in Tabithas life died he’d assure her that “Best friends aren’t always in human form. Except for me, of course. I will always be, yours. Your very best friend.” </p> <p>Uncle Jim liked words that started with “b" because he thought of “bulbous butts and big boobies.” Tabitha didn’t count each “thing” that concerned Uncle Jim, and despised the letter ‘B.’ What she could count on was that not one of Uncle Jim’s women with Febreze scented perfume would stick around or seek Tabitha’s company.</p> <p>The Dune motel was Uncle Jim’s sanctuary; his “mini vacation with super crisp sheets.” While he was away Tabitha watched re-runs of her favorite show, Friends, on T.V. While he was away she’d eat jars of pickles, leave the dishes piling in the sink, and walk around naked, shamelessly.</p>  <p>Claire insisted she was Tabitha’s only true friend. Claire wasn’t like any character on the show Friends but Tabitha thought that she was okay. Claire came around everyday to vent and smoke weed. Claire got high and binged on Tabitha ’s stock of Costco muffins and Cheetos. She’d ask “do you think my stomach is still flat?” “Did you say flat or fat?” Uncle Jim would chime in at times from his recliner  and yell “flat.” Tabitha wished she had a sibling as close as Uncle Jim had been to her mom.  Claire said that she and Tabitha were alone together in this world as lost sisters “From different misters hah. So clever” Claire thought.</p>  <p>Tabitha fell asleep with the red dust of Cheetos marinating her fingers, and crusted on her lips. She has fallen asleep each night like this for the past two weeks. Cheetos stained her hands and when she wakes up in the morning she takes each Oreo and splits it into two, just as her Mother used to do. She thought of how it would feel if she too were split into two as she wipes her Cheeto hands on one of Uncle Jim’s Hawaiian shirts. Uncle Jim doesn’t notice but wonders why sometimes, he smells like lime and stale corn. </p> <p>She popped a half of an Oreo into her mouth. She enjoyed the Oreo then fell back asleep. She woke looking up to the sky. She dreamed she could do the splits in midair. Tabitha  told her dream to Claire and moaned about how she made no tips working at the Mexican bakery. The next day Claire took Tabitha  to the “Giggly and Jiggly Girls Girls Girls Strip Club, “At this place you can practice your splits and make tips” Claire said to Tabitha.</p> <p>Spotlights steadily lit to illuminate the empty purple and red islands with poles on each. Tabitha  stared at the girl spinning herself slowly in a circle on center stage. Tabitha  thought that if a chimpanzee were forced to strip it would look like that dizzy girl. She was string cheese wobbling and on the borderline drooling. “I get so dizzy, I don’t know about spinning on a pole” Tabitha  said to Claire. The girl sauntered off the stage. A dog waddled toward the girls followed by a bleached blond man with his hair tied in a ponytail tied by a rubber band.  She assumed he was the bouncer, but he introduced himself as“The Boss,” and his “bouncer,” he joked, was the obese dog by his feet covered in moles and matted hair named “Dooney”.</p> <p>It was only 2 p.m but there were two clients and a couple girls lounging around the velvet couches. Tabitha breathed in “I’ll have to practice my splits.” </p> <p>The boss answered, “No problem. Just don’t puke on the floor. The girls will eventually let you in on everything you need to know if you decide to stay long enough. Or they may hate your guts.”Tabitha stared at the rubber band on his head and wondered how long it had been since he replaced it.</p>  <p>“No one really cares to see you dance. Just shake your ass, you can make plenty of cash” he said.</p> <p>Tabitha  looked at Claire. Despite Claire’s concave ass Tabitha knew that Claire had something Tabitha lacked; Claire wanted to be looked at like a goddess.  As the Boss talked Tabitha glanced into his office. Claire mouthed to Tabitha “Just try it.”</p> <p>The Boss told Tabitha to come back in two weeks once. He said that she’d make plenty of tips on her birthday, when she could legally work “barely legal.” He slipped into the warm light of his office, Tabitha noticed the empty cot he slept on just before he shut the door. The strobe lights were slowly changing from swampy green to light blue.</p> <p>“Your Uncle Jim... he doesn’t have to know. You’re innocence is already long gone, so what is there to lose now?” Claire said, sipping her gin. Tabitha stared off into the lights, “We’ll see” she said. Claire threw back her drink, wiped her mouth, slammed her glass on the bar. She pulled  a long hair out of her mouth and gave a hesitant laugh.</p><p>Claire came over for Tabitha ’s birthday, the eve of her first shift at “Giggly Jiggly Girls Girls Girls”.  Claire brought Safeway brownies and smeared the number 18 with her finger in the frosting. Tabitha wondered how many boys from her high school would decide to visit her at work and see her exposing herself to furry men with sticks and bugs buried in their beards. She had a dream that she got lost by staring into the deep cracks mapped on an old man’s face. In her dream everything smelled like celery and she was eager to find a rope or a swing so she jump into a blue pond, escaping the cracks of their skin. She woke up sweaty from this dream. She thought that if she made enough cash she could also buy some brushes, paint, maybe some pens and sketch pads. Her mother used to say that creativity was a pursuit of the easily amused.</p><p>Tabitha  wanted to be productive on her birthday. What better way to feel productive, than make money? She walked into the Giggly Jiggly in a tied Hawaiian shirt exposing her belly and a pair Uncle Jim’s cut-offs. Tabitha bent down to make friends with the Dooney, the canine bouncer. Tabitha  appreciated his rotund sausage dogs body.</p><p>“When it gets slow in here Dooney will keep you company” the Boss said.</p> <p> “Dooney the gloomy. I wish I could have a funny dog like you. A bulbous bulb of an old Shitzu.”</p> <p>“Good wordplay the guys will like that” the Boss said. Tabitha  walked into the boss’s office.</p> <p>“So do you want to see me dance?”</p> <p>“I am not paying you and I am gay,” the Boss said.</p> <p>“Oh,” she said. Tabitha  didn’t know how to do her face like the rest of the other girls.</p> <p>Tabitha’s mother would warn “Some people will want to think of you as trashy. Some people don’t understand how fun it is to play pretend. Some people don’t know how to make a living out of playing pretend but not me, not me.” </p> <p>Wisps of the boss’s blond hair moved as he talked. “If someone comes on too strong, tell them that you are gay. And if that doesn’t work stick a finger up your nose. Any freak will run to be confronted by someone freakier than them. Claire told me she had a friend. I didn’t think she’d bring in someone who would have a bigger butt than her.” Tabitha  wanted to work this job but couldn’t picture herself gyrating on stage. She could picture Claire spinning on the whirling on the pole, around and around.</p> <p>“Claire  has nice legs” Tabitha  said. The Boss raised his eyebrows then looked at Dooney.</p> <p>“I need to see your photo I.D so I know I am not hiring anyone under 18. House takes 30 bucks for every shift you work. Looney Dooney here keeps me company and he loves the ladies.” The sausage dog sneezed and the boss darted his hand away. Like the Boss the dog was also a mouth breather. “The German Shepard I had was a beaut, but it got hit by a truck on the freeway. Dooney can’t run. He can’t get much farther than the parking lot” he said.</p><p>“So what is good to know?” Tabitha said.</p> <p>“Chatting it up right is the best way to make tips and it is important to smile at every man’s joke, and if the joke isn’t funny to make the man into the joke.” he said.</p><p>She glance to check out the three strippers reclining in the velvet chairs, scrolling through their phones.</p> <p>“What do I do if someone gets in my face?” Tabitha said.</p>  <p>“You’ll figure it out as you go. If you’re only gonna be here for three weeks there’s certainly nothing to teach. Just don’t come in wearing socks and sandals. Please.” Tabitha appreciated the colorful tights and bright outfits of the girls reclining on plush couches.  She felt the escape through the flash of strobe lights. She felt the same feeling as when she rode her bike. This is the time maybe even the ideal time to dress up and play pretend she thought, as if she were a little kid.</p>  <p>“Noted” Tabitha said.</p> <p>“You can be daring, but not that daring” He said the girls will tell you about “Mr. Nasty” but otherwise your first shift if you want it starts tonight. </p> <p>Tabitha put on makeup like her mother. Covered in glittery eyeshadow and blowjob lipstick, she wore a tank top she cut up and pair of extra short cutoffs she stole from Uncle Jim’s.  Her neon bra peekaboo-d from the buttons of her oversized shirt. She went into the back room and asked a girl with bleach blonde hair and black highlights if she had any advice. The girl had kind eyes and and teeth spotted with black plaque like the dyed pattern on her head.</p> <p>“You have to chat, act nice to make them feel like men” the older stripper said “first you have to paint your face. The stripper lady painted Tabitha ’s face. Tabitha felt pretty the less she looked like herself. The seasoned stripper warned “Beware of Mr. Nasty.” She paused and looked straight on at Tabitha . She brushed Tabitha ’s cheeks with blush.</p> <p>“You know you remind me of a girl I used to know she worked at the club a long time ago I wish I remember her actual name, but she went by “Piper Luray.” </p> <p>“I am flattered” Tabitha said flatly. “I have yet to decide my stripper name.”</p><p>“It will come to you the older stripper said”</p><p>Uncle Jim was different whenever he wore Hawaiian shirts. The T.V was always on because he said it helped him fall asleep. Sometimes Claire and Tabitha  would lay in bed. say nothing until they fell asleep. Tabitha  imagined Claire’s body dead. She pictured spiders crawling out of Claire’s mouth. She felt like she was going to start wrinkling for being so mean. She reminded herself that if something happens so much you can only expect so much from someone.</p><p>The V.I.P room had a green light above the partitioned entrance which read “THE V.I.P DEN.” She walked into the nearly pitch black room. A girl was sprawled on the velvet couch embracing a hefty man. She walked out. “Oops” was all Tabitha  said.</p><p>Claire came out of the V.I.P room with makeup smeared on her face. The man staggered to Tabitha   with a confused face  “Is your name Piper?” Uncle Jim said “you look just like her. She was my favorite girl a curvy Heffalump, but mann, she could move.” </p><p>Tabitha  looked at the drunk man, “You’re Mr. Nasty?” She asked. </p> <p>Crumbs dripped from his beard onto his Hawaiian shirt.</p>  <p>“That is what the girls’ call me.  What’s your name Honey? I like your shir-”  He swayed then fell on his face. </p>');

A boy with a thin mustache rolled down the window and air pecked a kiss to me. The driver behind him flipped me off with the end tip of a banana lodged in his mouth.</p> <p>The dog knew I didn’t have enough doggy bags. I patted my body, slapping my thighs. I stared down the girls driving a mom’s tan Prius. They sipped through their straws and said nothing to each other, just gave me a look.</p> <p>One car stopped for us to cross the street after the dog was done with his business. The driver was a fellow with a face obscured by facial hair. He spit into a gatorade bottle and I told myself to walk more normal. I pulled the dog behind me.</p><p>I rubbed my hand on my forehead. I thought of Dory from finding Nemo, “Just keep swimming” I said.</p>");
